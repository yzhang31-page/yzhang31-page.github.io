## Current Projects

**I have a <span style="color: red;">PhD scholarship</span> for a potential candidate working on a project related to Virtual Reality Education Technology for Smart Museums.** The student will be awarded a PhD degree from the University of Liverpool (UK) upon successful completion of the program. 

**I am recruiting <span style="color: red;">research assistants</span> for my research projects.** Qualified RAs will be paid based on the XJTLU student salary standard. 

If you have experience and interest in the above positions, please feel free to send me an email: yue.li@xjtlu.edu.cn. 

<!-- #### Project 1: Engaging Students in Exploratory Modules Using Virtual Reality
This project seeks to leverage Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to facilitate the learning and teaching of exploratory modules at XJTLU. This project aims to combine and apply the lessons learned from previous VR practices in the School of Design (DES) and the School of Advanced Technology (SAT), and to further explore the use of VR in two exploratory modules: DES001 Explore Design and SAT001 Explore Advanced Technology. Specifically, this project will contribute to (1) a clarified understanding of students‚Äô and instructors‚Äô needs of VR in learning and teaching; (2) enhanced student engagement in learning activities and better delivery of the subject matter of the degree programmes within DES and SAT via a technology-enhanced approach; and (3) a user-centred system design - Explore001 VR system, which can be continuously used in future learning and teaching activities and for general demonstrations of design and advanced technology topics to a wider audience.

**Essential skills for RAs:**
1. Requirement collection and analysis
2. VR development with Unity
3. Strong communication skills 
 
See [DES001](http://modules.xjtlu.edu.cn/mod?mod_code=DES001) and [SAT001](http://modules.xjtlu.edu.cn/mod?mod_code=SAT001) for more details. -->

<!-- #### Project 2: Exploring Immersive Learning Through Virtual Reality Technology in IOM411 Logistics and Physical Distribution
This project aims to develop a virtual warehouse management scene that students could get into and fulfill typical tasks such as receiving, put away, inventory transfer, packing, and dispatching, etc. in a role-playing model by wearing VR goggles. Specifically, two episodes including an inbound material receiving process and an outbound material dispatching process will be developed in the virtual scene for students. An instructor manual and student manual guiding the VR technology integrated learning and teaching in the classroom will also be developed accompany with the virtual environment construction. The ultimate goal is to provide an immerse learning environment for students to enhance their understanding of warehouse management activities in this module.

**Essential skills for RAs:**
1. 3D modelling
2. VR development with Unity
3. Domain knowledge about logistics and physical distribution

See [IOM411](http://modules.xjtlu.edu.cn/mod?mod_code=IOM001) for more details. -->

<!-- #### PhD Project: Virtual Reality Education Technology for Smart Museums

The smart museum is a new trend driven by the national strategy and a foundational project to make cultural relics ‚Äòcome alive‚Äô, and Virtual Reality (VR) technology has become the key technology for the construction of smart museums. However, there are still many key problems to be solved in the construction of smart museums. In view of the insufficient understanding of the learning mechanisms, limited interactive experience and lack of public engagement in the smart museum, this project plans to carry out research work on virtual environment learning mechanisms, display and interaction techniques, and virtual curation practices. Combining theoretical methods from pedagogy, museology, computer science, informatics and other interdisciplinary fields, this research will conduct empirical studies and analysis to clarify the key mechanisms for users to actively participate in cultural heritage learning within the virtual environment. With combined user activity monitoring and brain-computer interface technology, user interaction intention and behavior models will be constructed to explore display approaches and interaction techniques in the virtual learning environment. This project aims to make contributions to the field of VR education, and to provide insights for the construction and development of smart museums. -->


#### Research Assistant Projects

- Virtual Reality Education Technology for Smart Museums
- Extended Reality Collaboration Technology for Metaverse
- Engaging Spectators in Virtual Reality
- Revisualization of Architectural Heritage with Heritage Building Information System (H-BIM) and Extended Reality (XR) Technology
- ... any other projects that align with my research interests :)
<!-- Virtual Reality (VR) is being increasingly adopted in education, training, exhibition, and entertainment, lots of which are embedded within specific social contexts. Current uses of head-mounted display (HMD) support immersive experience by isolating users from the real world, whereas spectators around are only allowed to passively observe a VR user‚Äôs firstperson perspective. This limitation restricts the use of VR in the social context, such as classrooms and museums, where activities take place among a group of people and social interactions are expected. To better support the use of VR in such inherent social context, this research aims to investigate the interaction techniques for engaging spectators in VR and to provide guidelines for designing socially acceptable VR experience. -->

## Student Projects
I am happy to supervise student dissertations and final year projects in SAT301, SAT405 and SAT406, as well as summer research for HCI/VR/AR related projects and student competitions.

For XJTLU students who are interested in doing projects with me, please feel free to send me an email: yue.li@xjtlu.edu.cn.

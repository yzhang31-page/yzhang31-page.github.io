## There is more to life ☕️ than work 💻. 

<div>
<p> I’m <b>Yue</b> 🌝 when not being Dr Li. </p>

<p> 📍 I live in <b>Suzhou</b>, a city located in the east of China with more than 2500 years of history. </p> 

<p> 👊 I like adventure, sports and <b>adventure sports</b>. </p>
<p>
I started <b>rock climbing</b> 🧗‍♀️ in 2017 and it has become an important part of my life. <br>
<ul>
It trains my determination, focus, endurance and strength 💪. <br>
It fights depression and rewards me with confidence and satisfaction from well-earned victory ✌️. <br>
It brings me to the beautiful natural areas and heights 🏔 that I’ll never reach otherwise. <br>
</ul>
The best part is always the amazing <b>people</b> that I meet, climb together and become <b>friends</b> with 👭.
</p>
<p> I also practice <em>yoga</em> 🧘‍♀️, <em>dancing</em> 💃, <em>snowboarding</em> 🏂 and <em>diving</em> (AOW) 🤿, and I am always happy to try new things. </p>

You may also find me in an exquisite <em>cafe</em> ☕️ with a cup of latte, or hanging around in <em>museums and galleries</em> 🏛. <br>
I occasionally do some <em>design</em> work 💎 and <em>photography</em> 📷 for fun. 
</p>

<p>
At home, I play <em>Just Dance</em> 💃 and <em>Overcooked</em> 👩‍🍳 on Switch or <em>Beat Saber</em> ⚔ in VR.<br>
One day I'll have a <em>dog</em> 🐶, very likely a Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Bailey 🌰.
